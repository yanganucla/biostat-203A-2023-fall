The final project will present you with an opportunity to use some of the skills you have learned throughout the quarter in Biostatistics 203A including manipulating and summarizing data, creating graphs and tables, conducting statistical tests, simulating data, and composing a report. 

In the first part of this final project we will be analyzing data from a multi-wave survey called How Couples Meet and Stay Together (HCMST). The intent of the survey was to learn more about how Americans met their spouses and romantic partners and to compare traditional and non-traditional couples. During the first wave, couples were asked about their relationship status and the sample we will be analyzing includes only those respondents that indicated having a spouse or other romantic partnership at this first wave. Data for this study were obtained from ICPSR (Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research), an excellent source for interesting publicly-available data sets.
